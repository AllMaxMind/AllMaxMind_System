  "fullExample": "### WHO IS AFFECTED?\nCurrently, we face a serious bottleneck in the purchase order approval process. The current flow depends on shared Excel spreadsheets which frequently generate duplicates and lost orders.\n\nThe Procurement team (6 people) is involved, as well as the Finance department. Monthly, approximately 200-300 purchase orders go through this manual process.\n\n### CURRENT SOLUTION?\nThis results in delays of up to 15-20 days for urgent purchase approvals. The Procurement team spends about 40 hours weekly just searching for orders in emails and reorganizing them in spreadsheets.\n\nBeyond that, we have an 8-10% error rate (duplicate orders or late cancellations that generate supplier penalties).\n\n### IDEAL SCENARIO?\nWe need a system that centralizes all purchase requests and approvals, automatically notifies each manager about pending orders in their domain, and integrates with our ERP (SAP).\n\nThe cycle time should reduce to 2-3 days, with complete audit trail and tracking of each approval. The system should alert when a supplier has multiple open orders.\n\n### WHAT REFERENCES DO YOU HAVE?\nReferences and inspirations: We use Jira for project management and like its intuitive interface. The Salesforce approval flow that our Sales team uses is good, but needs customization.\n\nWe also know about Totvs Procurement solution (used by companies similar to ours), but it's expensive. We're open to a custom solution that integrates better with our tech stack.",
